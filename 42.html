        <h2>Minishell</h2>
        <p>
          A shell written in C with a feature set inspired by bash. This project
          provided invaluable experience in working with system calls and
          understanding their interactions with the kernel. Developing Minishell
          allowed me to dive deep into signal handling, process management, and
          the creation of a resilient application capable of withstanding
          various runtime scenarios. One of the most challenging aspects was
          handling user input, which is inherently unpredictable. Ensuring that
          the shell was secure against potential attack vectors required
          meticulous attention to detail and robust error handling. This project
          was an excellent learning experience, enhancing my skills in low-level
          programming and system-level operations.
        </p>

        <h2>cub3D</h2>
        <p>
          A project implementing raycasting in C, reminiscent of the classic
          game Wolfenstein 3D. This engaging project involved creating a basic
          3D graphics engine using the minilibX library, allowing me to handle
          real-time rendering and graphical computations. Through cub3D, I
          gained a deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts behind
          raycasting and the techniques used in game development, such as
          handling different events and optimizing performance. This project was
          particularly rewarding as it combined my interest in graphics with
          practical programming skills, providing a solid foundation in both
          areas.

        <h2>Inception</h2>
        <p>
          A project focused on learning the fundamentals of containerization and
          deployment using Docker. Through Inception, I explored the process of
          setting up and managing multiple services within containers, gaining
          hands-on experience with Docker's capabilities. The project, along
          with its bonus tasks, required configuring various services, such as
          web servers, databases, and application servers, to work seamlessly
          together in a containerized environment. This experience was
          instrumental in understanding the principles of DevOps and the
          importance of scalable, isolated application environments. The project
          also emphasized the practical aspects of container orchestration and
          management. In this project I also learned to setup those services.
