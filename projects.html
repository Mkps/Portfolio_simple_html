        <h2>ML_LinearRegression</h2>
        <p>
          A C++ class to implement Linear Regression in a machine learning
          context. This project involves creating a comprehensive C++ class that
          performs linear regression analysis, enabling users to model
          relationships between variables. The class includes methods for
          training the model using a dataset, making predictions based on new
          data, and evaluating the model's performance through metrics such as
          Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. The implementation is
          optimized for performance and can handle large datasets efficiently.
          This project demonstrates a strong understanding of both machine
          learning principles and C++ programming.

        <h2>Slotbot</h2>
        <p>
          A web bot made to take evaluation slots at 42 Paris. Made with
          Selenium and Python, this project automates the process of booking
          evaluation slots, saving time and reducing the likelihood of human
          error. Slotbot navigates the web interface of the 42 Paris platform,
          logs in with user credentials, and selects available slots based on
          predefined criteria. The bot handles various edge cases such as
          session timeouts and unexpected pop-ups. This project showcases skills
          in web automation, Python scripting, and the use of Selenium WebDriver
          for browser control.
        </p>

        <h2>PowerManager</h2>
        <p>
          A complete battery management suite written in C and powered by
          GTK4.0. This application replicates the functionalities of Lenovo
          Vantage but is designed specifically for Linux-based systems.
          PowerManager allows users to monitor battery health, set charging
          thresholds, and optimize power settings for enhanced battery life. The
          suite includes a user-friendly graphical interface built with GTK4.0,
          providing a seamless experience for managing power settings. The
          project involves intricate handling of system-level battery
          information and integrating it with the GTK framework. This project
          highlights proficiency in C programming, GUI development, and
          cross-platform software design.
